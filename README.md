# FRESHMusicPlayer (For Weebs)
Better known as FMPFW, this is just your basic music player. Might be useful to look at if you want to make your own music player, I suppose.
#Dependencies
- Python 3.x (only tested with 3.6 and 3.7, but any 3.x version should work, I hope)
- Pygame
#Notes
This program uses the drag n'drop functionality of AppJar, which may not work on certain Linux distributions. You will also have to do some slight modification to get it to work on anything other than Windows PCs.
